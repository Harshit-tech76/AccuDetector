License Plate Detection and Recognition

License plate detection and recognition are critical components in a variety of applications, including intelligent vehicle systems, smart trafficking and law enforcement. Existing models which are used for this purpose have poor performance and are not cost-effective. So in order to achievea stable and accurate license plate detector and recogniser, an integrated approach to license plate identification and recognition that takes advantage of cutting-edge techniques in object detection and character recognition is enabled. It utilises the multi layer skip connection CNN model for recognition along with YOLO model for detection. These are validated using public standard datasets like ALOP, ALPR, ANPR and ChineseLP. Along with these, UFPR-ALPR is used to validate CNN skip connection. Finally, the best performing versions for both YOLO part as well as CNN part are pipe-lined to provide a final working model which will be the most efficient and accurate. The model after analysis indicates that YOLOv8 is best performing among all versions with F1 score of 98 %, recall of 96.84 % and precision of 99.19 %. The CNN skip connection has 99.68 % training accuracy, 0.0123 % training loss, 97.46 % validation accuracy, and 0.2444 % validation loss, and is best performing model for recognition.
